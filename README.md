# Recombination-manuscript
Rare recombination in Salix nivalis and the maintenance of homomorphic sex chromosomes in willows
Here is the script used for mapping the sequence capture reads of all three species against Salix purpurea reference genome. I mapped all three species against pupurea Z and W chromosome both. So, this is just a generalized script. Filenames and genomes were changed for each runs. Reference was downloaded from JGI website.
Allelic state plot shows the heterozygosity for each sex-linked SNPS across all species when mapped against reference genome.
